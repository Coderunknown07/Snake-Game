# Snake-Game 
Snake Game in Python: A Classic Reimagined

Relive the nostalgic arcade experience with this Python implementation of the classic Snake game.

Navigate through a maze-like environment, controlling a growing snake that gobbles up food items. Avoid crashing into walls or your own tail to survive.

Our game features smooth movement, engaging sound effects, and increasing difficulty to keep you hooked.

Experience the magic of Python game development with this project, and feel free to contribute your ideas and code.
